# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the rock paper scissors game project from the odin project. It is mainly an excercise of logic building using javascript along with a thorogh practice of DOM manipulation on webpages. This also utilises many of the html and css techniques I have learny as part of the introductory course.
