# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the rock paper scissors game project from the odin project. It is mainly an excercise of logic building using javascript along with a thorogh practice of DOM manipulation on webpages. This also utilises many of the html and css techniques I have learny as part of the introductory course.

The code will probably be revisited time and again as I learn optimised methods to achieve my goals or to add fun features to this project since I want to use it to gauge how far I have made it in my growth in this journey.
